# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project is to create a study guide website for students in the Columbia Coding Boot Camp.
I created this in order to organize valuable information about the work done in the prework section of the program so that I, and others, could review and study it when needed.
This solves the problem of organizing and storing that information in an easy-to-access place.
In the creation of this project I learned HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, and how to synthesize them into an operational webpage.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Use the section cards to view and refresh yourself on the information about each topic. Opening Chrom DevTools by right-clicking and selecting "inspect" you can see a panel with tabs at the top. Selecting the tab "console" allows you to see a list of the topics learned in the prework section of the program and a suggestion of which to study first. Refreshing the page will provide a randomly-chosen topic to study.
